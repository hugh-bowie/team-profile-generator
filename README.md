# Description

This is a command-line application that accepts user input.<br>
When prompted for my team members and their information,
 an HTML file is generated that displays a nicely formatted team roster based on user input.<br>
When I click on an email address in the HTML, 
 my default email program opens and populates the TO field of the email with the address.<br>
When I click on the GitHub username,
 that GitHub profile opens in a new tab.<br>
When I start the application,
 I am prompted to enter the team manager’s name, employee ID, email address, and office number.<br>
When I enter the team manager’s name, employee ID, email address, and office number,
 I am presented with a menu with the option to add an engineer or an intern or to finish building my team.<br>
When I select the engineer option,
 I am prompted to enter the engineer’s name, ID, email, and GitHub username, and I am taken back to the menu.<br>
When I select the intern option,
 I am prompted to enter the intern’s name, ID, email, and school, and I am taken back to the menu.<br>
When I decide to finish building my team,
 I exit the application, and the HTML is generated.<br>
